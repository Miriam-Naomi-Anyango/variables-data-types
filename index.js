// A variable is a container in which we can store values for later retrieval.

/* Variable Names in Javascript*
Start every variable name with a lowercase letter. Variable names starting with a number are not valid.
Don't use spaces. If a variable name consists of multiple words, camelCaseYourVariableNames (see the camel humps?) instead of snake_casing_them (think of the underscore as a snake that swallowed the words).
Don't use JavaScript reserved words (Links to an external site.) or future reserved words (Links to an external site.).

Initializing Variables in JavaScript
Initializing variables in JavaScript is really a two-step process: first, we declare the variable, then we assign a value to it.*/
